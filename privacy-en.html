        <h1>Privacy Policy for TriggerTime</h1>
        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 17, 2026</p>

        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>Welcome to <strong>TriggerTime</strong>. We value and respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how
            we handle information within our application. The core principle of our app is that <strong>we do not
                collect, transmit, or share your personal information with anyone</strong>.</p>

        <h3>2. Information Collection</h3>
        <p>Our application does not require user account registration. We do not request or collect personally
            identifiable information (such as name, email address, phone number, or precise GPS location) for the use of
            the application.</p>

        <h3>3. Training and Session Data</h3>
        <p>The primary function of <strong>TriggerTime</strong> is to help you record and analyze your sports
            performance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Type:</strong> The app allows you to input technical data related to your shooting practice
                (scores, training dates, ammunition types, equipment notes, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> All information you enter is stored <strong>exclusively locally</strong> on
                your device's internal memory.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. No Data Transfer</h3>
        <p>Since the application operates entirely offline:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not send your data to external servers or the "cloud."</li>
            <li>We (the developer) do not have access to your training data or historical logs.</li>
            <li>If you delete the application from your device, the stored data will be permanently deleted (unless you
                have performed a manual backup of the device).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Device Permissions</h3>
        <p>To function correctly, the application may request access to certain native features of your device. These
            permissions are used strictly for the app's functionality and not to collect data about you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Storage / Files:</strong> To save the database of your scores and training sessions on the
                device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>This application does not use third-party analytics services or advertising networks that track user
            behavior. High privacy standards are fundamental to our mission.</p>

        <h3>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
